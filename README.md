# MAUI dotnet Bot Demo

## Introduction
Welcome to the MAUI dotnet Bot demo! This project aims to showcase the capabilities of .NET MAUI by integrating 3D assets using Evergine. By extending the default .NET MAUI template, we've incorporated engaging 3D content to demonstrate the exciting possibilities of this framework.

This demo was featured in the enlightening session titled "Building 3D Apps with .NET MAUI and Evergine," presented during the Microsoft .NET Conf 2023. For a detailed walkthrough, you can watch the [session on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWAXrP69QX4).
